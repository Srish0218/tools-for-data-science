Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. (1 pt)


# 
# Arithmetic expressions are mathematical expressions that involve arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are commonly used in programming and mathematical calculations. Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:
# 
# 1. Addition:
#    - `3 + 5`: Evaluates to 8
# 
# 2. Subtraction:
#    - `10 - 4`: Evaluates to 6
# 
# 3. Multiplication:
#    - `6 * 4`: Evaluates to 24
#    - `3.5 * 2.5`: Evaluates to 8.75
# 
# 4. Division:
#    - `15 / 3`: Evaluates to 5
#    - `10.5 / 2`: Evaluates to 5.25
#     
# These examples demonstrate basic arithmetic operations using both integers and floating-point numbers. Arithmetic expressions can also include parentheses to control the order of operations and complex mathematical functions for more advanced calculations. Understanding and working with arithmetic expressions is essential in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and data analysis.
# 

# In[8]:


# Arithmetic operations
print("5+4: ")
code = compile("5 + 4", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)



# In[9]:


import math
# Volume of a sphere
print("volumn of sphere")
code2 = compile("\n4 / 3 * math.pi * math.pow(25, 3)", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code2)


# Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers.(2 pts)
# 
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
# 

# In[12]:


(3*4)+5


# Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)
# 
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[14]:


min=200

hours=200/60
print(hours)


# # Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives.
# 
# Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.

# # Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author’s name.
